# FCompressor: a convenient tool for compressing a lot of videos at the same time with no effort

## How it works

FCompressor searches for videofiles(files with an extension of .mp4/.avi/.mkv), and launches independent instances of `ffmpeg` for each video file, so if there was 25 video files, it will launch 25 instances of `ffmpeg`, and then FCompressor will exit. To shut down the compression process, you need to shut down every instance of `ffmpeg` manually. That's how it works ü§∑‚Äç. But later in development FCompressor will stay open while `ffmpeg` does it's thing, and you will be able to shut down every instance of `ffmpeg` by simpy exiting FCompressor.

## Usage
Very easy, you just pass the input dir, and the output dir, like this:
```bash
java -jar FCompressor.jar "/path/to/input" "/path/to/output" <args>
```
There are also a few args:

`--crf` - passes the Constant Rate Factor. Basically it defines the quality of a compressed video. It is recommended to not touch this setting. Default is 28.

`--codec` - self-explanatory, sets the `ffmpeg` codec. By default, it is `libx265`. It is recommended to not touch this setting, only if you know what you do.

`--accept-warnings` - accepts warnings by FCompressor.

Basically you can just pass the input and the output, FCompressor will do the rest. 

## Backstory

FCompressor has actually born when I needed to compress a
lot of anime series I downloaded to watch on a trip with friends.
Videos were pretty heavy, and also considering that my laptop has only
256 GB of storage, I needed to compress that all. I knew I can use `ffmpeg`
for compression, but I don't want to constantly start a new process for
compressing every video. I just wanted to start the process, leave
the laptop to do it's work, and then watch the result. And this is where FCompressor has born :D

The name is FCompressor, which is translated to Folder Compressor. Compressor of all videos in a folder. Pretty self-explanatory, huh? :D

## Requirements
Installed `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and JRE 11, that's all. That's the only thing you'll need to start FCompressor.

If you don't have `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`, install it using this command:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

That's all, I hope you will be satisfied with this tool :D Happy using!
