# FCompressor: a convenient tool for compressing a lot of videos at the same time with no effort

FCompressor has actually born when I needed to compress a
lot of anime series I downloaded to watch on a trip with friends.
Videos were pretty heavy, and also considering that my laptop has only
256 GB of storage, i needed to compress that all. I knew I can use FFMpeg
for compression, but I dont want to constantly start a new process for
compressing every video. I just wanted to start the process, leave
the laptop to do it's work, and then watch the result. And this is where FCompressor has born :D

The name is FCompressor, which is translated to Folder Compressor. Compressor of all videos in a folder. Pretty self-explanatory, huh? :D
